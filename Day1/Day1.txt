BIgdata Project Phases:

1. Data Acquisition
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Data Transformation
4. Data View 
5. Intelligence Layer


Data Acquisition: Getting raw data and storing it in persistant storage (Collect and Store)

Hadoop:

	File -------------->  copyFromLocal  ---------------> HDFS
				put
				Hue

	Database---------->  Apache Sqoop -----------> HDFS
	
	Streams ---------->  Apache Flume  ------------> HDFS

Spark:
	
	File -------------> write() in DF  ---------------> HDFS
		
	Database ---------> jdbc() in DF -----------------> HDFS

	Streams ---------> Spark Streaming ---------------> HDFS
				DStreams


Data Preprocessing: Make the data compatible for transformation.

	e.g. Unifying the data

Data Transformation: Transformation operations like
			a. Filter
			b. Sort
			c. Group
			d. Join
			e. Union etc


Data View: Making the data queryable (Near Realtime/Realtime outputs)

		SQL, NoSQL, SparkSQL

Intelligence Layer: Extracting intelligence out of the data

		ML , DL, Data Mining, Dashboarding, Vis etc





Cloud Computing ----- National Institute of Standards and Technologies (US)
------------------


Cloud computing is not a technical term. Its a business term.

Cloud computing is a model to perform

	- Delivery of IT and IT-enabled services over the Internet
	- Services are charged based on Pay per usage model


As per NIST,

Cloud computing is a model that enables,
	
	UBIQUITOUS (Any network / any web-enabled device)
	ON-DEMAND ( I can use my service anytime 24/7/365 )
	CONVENIENT (no third party/broker involved. Everything is direct)

access to the shared pool of CONFIGURABLE computing resources that can be
	
	RAPIDLY PROVISIONED AND RELEASED

with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.






Cloud Service and Deployment Models
=====================================

As per NIST there exists 3 service models and 4 deployment models

3 Service Models
	a. SaaS (Software as a Service)

		- Targetted towards End User
		- They provide software 
		- Here the infra and the software is managed by the service provider
		- E.g. GMail, Google Docs, GDrive, OneDrive, DropBox etc


	b. PaaS (Platform as a Service)
		
		- Provides platform mostly for developers
		- Platform content is managed by Dev where as the underlying Infra is managed by                   the service provider.
		- Wordpress,Drupal,Joomla (Content Management System)
	
	c. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

		- Hardware on Demand Service
		- Provision yourself with a Virtual Machine
			- RAM,DISK,CPU,GPU,OS,Network,Internet



4 Deployment Models:

	1. Private Cloud
	2. Public Cloud
	3. Community Cloud
	4. Hybrid Cloud
	

	1. Private Cloud:
		- Cloud is deployed for a specific organization
		- Organization owns the data and the hardware
		- Management, maintenance and all related activities are done by the 		  organization.

	2. Public Cloud:
		- Cloud maintained by an organization for public use.
		- Organization owns the hardware
		- Ideally when it comes to data ownership, it depends on the SLA(Service Level                   Agreement)

	3. Community Cloud:
		- Cloud is maintained by one organization can be used by a limited set of orgn.
		- Organization owns the hardware
		- Ideally when it comes to data ownership, it depends on the SLA(Service Level                   Agreement)

	4. Hybrid Cloud:
		- Combination setup of Public and Private cloud	
		- Maintain data in Private cloud and use apps from public cloud
		- Data is owned by one party and infra is owned by another party
